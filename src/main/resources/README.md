To load attendee data from file,
make a copy of `attendees.csv.sample` and rename it into `attendees.csv`,
then fill it with your users' data in the same format
`First Name,Last Name,E-Mail`.


Same for `prizes.csv.sample`, that must be copied into `prizes.csv`, 
then filled with details in format `Name,Details`.
